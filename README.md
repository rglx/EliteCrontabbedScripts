# EliteCrontabbedScripts

## description
repository of crontabbed elite scripts i run off of my server for posting information to discord channels

## installation
clone this repository into your location of choice
install `node` (most recent LTS version from the site is my recommendation but any should work)
install `npm` (should've come with nodejs)
use npm to install `request` to this folder
run the scripts manually or with crontab. try 'nodejs <script>` without arguments to get an explanation of what each one needs.

## more info
read the first few comments of each script for more information on what they do.

## [file issues and errors and problems here](/../../issues)
